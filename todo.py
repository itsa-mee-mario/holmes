Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly stupid could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the NON-existence of God.
The argument goes like this:
I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.'
But,' says Man, The Bad PrOgRamMiNg Kirby is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.'
Oh dear,' says God, I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly disappears in a puff of logic.
