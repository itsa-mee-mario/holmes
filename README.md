## minimal homepage with:
1. a clock, 
2. todo list, 
3. random reading link button, 
4. and a habit tracker.

---
 youll need to make your own habits directory, and have your own reading list. replace the name "hn-links.txt" in the code to make it work
 
 ---
 this was originally intended to be run on an rpi server and have it sync using syncthing but i dont have a free rpi lying around so running this with a cron job will have to do.
